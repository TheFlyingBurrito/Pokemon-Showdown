/**
 * Commands
 * Pokemon Showdown - http://pokemonshowdown.com/
 *
 * These are commands. For instance, you can define the command 'whois'
 * here, then use it by typing /whois into Pokemon Showdown.
 *
 * A command can be in the form:
 *   ip: 'whois',
 * This is called an alias: it makes it so /ip does the same thing as
 * /whois.
 *
 * But to actually define a command, it's a function:
 *   birkal: function(target, room, user) {
 *     this.sendReply("It's not funny anymore.");
 *   },
 *
 * Commands are actually passed five parameters:
 *   function(target, room, user, connection, cmd, message)
 * Most of the time, you only need the first three, though.
 *
 * target = the part of the message after the command
 * room = the room object the message was sent to
 *   The room name is room.id
 * user = the user object that sent the message
 *   The user's name is user.name
 * connection = the connection that the message was sent from
 * cmd = the name of the command
 * message = the entire message sent by the user
 *
 * If a user types in "/msg zarel, hello"
 *   target = "zarel, hello"
 *   cmd = "msg"
 *   message = "/msg zarel, hello"
 *
 * Commands return the message the user should say. If they don't
 * return anything or return something falsy, the user won't say
 * anything.
 *
 * Commands have access to the following functions:
 *
 * this.sendReply(message)
 *   Sends a message back to the room the user typed the command into.
 *
 * this.sendReplyBox(html)
 *   Same as sendReply, but shows it in a box, and you can put HTML in
 *   it.
 *
 * this.popupReply(message)
 *   Shows a popup in the window the user typed the command into.
 *
 * this.add(message)
 *   Adds a message to the room so that everyone can see it.
 *   This is like this.sendReply, except everyone in the room gets it,
 *   instead of just the user that typed the command.
 *
 * this.send(message)
 *   Sends a message to the room so that everyone can see it.
 *   This is like this.add, except it's not logged, and users who join
 *   the room later won't see it in the log, and if it's a battle, it
 *   won't show up in saved replays.
 *   You USUALLY want to use this.add instead.
 *
 * this.logEntry(message)
 *   Log a message to the room's log without sending it to anyone. This
 *   is like this.add, except no one will see it.
 *
 * this.addModCommand(message)
 *   Like this.add, but also logs the message to the moderator log
 *   which can be seen with /modlog.
 *
 * this.logModCommand(message)
 *   Like this.addModCommand, except users in the room won't see it.
 *
 * this.can(permission)
 * this.can(permission, targetUser)
 *   Checks if the user has the permission to do something, or if a
 *   targetUser is passed, check if the user has permission to do
 *   it to that user. Will automatically give the user an "Access
 *   denied" message if the user doesn't have permission: use
 *   user.can() if you don't want that message.
 *
 *   Should usually be near the top of the command, like:
 *     if (!this.can('potd')) return false;
 *
 * this.canBroadcast()
 *   Signifies that a message can be broadcast, as long as the user
 *   has permission to. This will check to see if the user used
 *   "!command" instead of "/command". If so, it will check to see
 *   if the user has permission to broadcast (by default, voice+ can),
 *   and return false if not. Otherwise, it will set it up so that
 *   this.sendReply and this.sendReplyBox will broadcast to the room
 *   instead of just the user that used the command.
 *
 *   Should usually be near the top of the command, like:
 *     if (!this.canBroadcast()) return false;
 *
 * this.canTalk()
 *   Checks to see if the user can speak in the room. Returns false
 *   if the user can't speak (is muted, the room has modchat on, etc),
 *   or true otherwise.
 *
 *   Should usually be near the top of the command, like:
 *     if (!this.canTalk()) return false;
 *
 * this.canTalk(message)
 *   Checks to see if the user can say the message. In addition to
 *   running the checks from this.canTalk(), it also checks to see if
 *   the message has any banned words or is too long. Returns the
 *   filtered message, or a falsy value if the user can't speak.
 *
 *   Should usually be near the top of the command, like:
 *     target = this.canTalk(target);
 *     if (!target) return false;
 *
 * this.parse(message)
 *   Runs the message as if the user had typed it in.
 *
 *   Mostly useful for giving help messages, like for commands that
 *   require a target:
 *     if (!target) return this.parse('/help msg');
 *
 *   After 10 levels of recursion (calling this.parse from a command
 *   called by this.parse from a command called by this.parse etc)
 *   we will assume it's a bug in your command and error out.
 *
 * this.targetUserOrSelf(target)
 *   If target is blank, returns the user that sent the message.
 *   Otherwise, returns the user with the username in target, or
 *   a falsy value if no user with that username exists.
 *
 * this.splitTarget(target)
 *   Splits a target in the form "user, message" into its
 *   constituent parts. Returns message, and sets this.targetUser to
 *   the user, and this.targetUsername to the username.
 *
 *   Remember to check if this.targetUser exists before going further.
 *
 * Unless otherwise specified, these functions will return undefined,
 * so you can return this.sendReply or something to send a reply and
 * stop the command there.
